#Problem 1

```{r}
set.seed(1)

samp_df = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
   greater_than_0 = samp > 0,
    samp_character = c("apple","strawberry","strawberry","peach","apple","peach","peach","apple", "peach","strawberry"),
    samp_factor = factor(samp_character)
)


```


```{r}

#take the mean of each vaiable in the dataframe.
mean(pull(samp_df,samp))
mean(pull(samp_df,greater_than_0))
mean(pull(samp_df,samp_character))
mean(pull(samp_df,samp_factor))

```

R can only take the mean of the random sampe of 10 from a standard Normal distribution (numeric) and the logical vector.
It cannot take the mean of character vector and factor vector and therefore returning NA.
